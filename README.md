## Project Overview

**Uncrypt** was developed by **Team Route 35** as a school project (we spent a little over 3 months creating this game...), presenting a unique approach to cybersecurity education. Instead of traditional tutorials, we put players in the shoes of a computer virus to teach them security concepts from an attacker's perspective because understanding how systems are compromised is the first step to protecting them.

More Details can be found in the **Game Design Document**: https://spiny-twister-fd0.notion.site/Uncrypt-GDD-1d7e65d1a24880a2b812d80183b32c4c?pvs=4 

## About Route 35
Route 35 is a creative subteam formed specifically for projects that diverge from Cupflowâ€™s main line of work. Originally, Cupflow was established by Aless and Scstefan as a collaborative identity under which they produced various creative works. For certain projects, such as school-related competitions or experimental releases that fall outside of Cupflowâ€™s typical scope, a new team identity was needed.
Thus, Route 35 was created. It retains Cupflowâ€™s core members and creative style while allowing flexibility in team composition and project direction. For the project in question, Route 35 included Aless, Scstefan, Bluwolf (who contributed modeling, textures, sound effects, and writing), and one additional team member who helped with minor things and preferred to remain anonymous.

Credits for this project

- **Scstefan** - Main Artist (Character design, level art)
- **Bluwolf** - 3D Modeler & Sound Designer (Assets, audio systems)

## Running the Project

### For Players

1. Download the latest build from our itch.io page: https://cupflow-studios.itch.io/uncrypt
2. Extract and run `Uncrypt.exe`
> [!NOTE]
> Please fully extract the game before playing. Running it directly from WinRAR or other archive tools may cause issues.
3. Follow the in-game tutorial!

### For Developers

1. Clone this repository
2. Open in Unity 6
3. Key scenes are located in `/Assets/Scenes/`:
   - `HUB.unity` - Starting area and tutorial
   - `Firewall.unity` - First gameplay area
   - `FileSystem.unity` - Second gameplay area
4. Read through the md files and the GDD to gain additional info about the codebase

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that while we tried to keep the code clean we had to rush some things to meet the project's deadline. If you find something that should be improved let us know in the issues, so we can improve our next projects! 

### Key Gameplay Elements

**Terminal Integration**: We implemented a terminal system that accepts some real Linux commands. Players use `nmap` to scan for open ports, navigate with `cd` and `ls`, and execute simple security tools just like in real-world penetration testing.

**Educational Progression**: Each area introduces new concepts: port scanning in the Firewall, file system navigation in the File System, and decryption mechanics throughout. The learning curve is designed to be accessible to newcomers while remaining similar to actual cybersecurity tools.

**Combat & Exploration**: To keep engagement high, we balanced educational content with action. Players battle antivirus programs,and solve puzzles while learning how protective measures work in reality.

## Key Systems

The main systems we have implemented are:
- **Behaviour Tree** for enemy AI, allowing for complex and responsive behaviors throughout the game.
    ```csharp
    // Example
    BehaviourTree = new BehaviourTreeBuilder("Check Player Status")
                    .StartSequence("Check Player Status")
                        .If("Can View Player", () => CanViewPlayer)
                            .If("Can Attack Player", () => IsNearPlayer)
                                .Then(attack)
                            .Else(patrolSequence)
                        .Else("Idle", () => animator.SetBool(IsPatrolling, false))
                    .Build();
    ```
- **State Machine** for managing the player's move set.
- **Singleton System** for passing references between GameObjects:
    - Persistent Singletons `PersistentSingleton<T>`: These are created at the start of the game and persist across scenes.
    - Scene-specific Singletons `SceneSingleton<T>`: These are temporary and are destroyed when the scene changes.
- **Save System** to allow players to pick up where they left off.
- **Dialogue System** to enable complex dialogues with interactive events and reactions.
- **Terminal System**

## Visual Design

![Concept Art](./.github/concept.webp)

### 2.5D Implementation
We chose a 2.5D style combining 2D characters with 3D environments. This approach gave us the performance benefits of 2D sprites while allowing detailed environments.

### Art Pipeline
```
Tools Used:
- Procreate: Character concept art and sprite creation
- Blender: 3D modeling and environment assets
- Unity: Final integration and shader work
```

### Animation System
Characters use a state-based animation system with four core states: Idle, Walk, Alert, and Attack. We implemented direction-based animations using sprite mirroring to avoid drawing unnecessary work load.

## Educational Content Structure

### Firewall Section
Teaches network security fundamentals, including how firewalls filter traffic and the concept of open ports. Players learn to use network scanning tools while navigating volcanic security defenses.

### File System Section
Introduces file system organization and basic cryptography. Players discover encryption keys hidden throughout a peaceful digital landscape, learning about data protection and decryption processes.

### Terminal Integration
Throughout both sections, an interactive terminal teaches real command-line operations used in cybersecurity, from port scanning to file navigation.
